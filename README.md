## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I'm sure my code could be cleaner. I will study some more JS and come back to this code and fix it. For now I'm happy that it works :)

### Useful resources
